                DeepMine is a Play-and-Earn social economy strategy in the
                Sci-Fi-themed metaverse. DeepMine is about cooperation, free
                market economy and this simple mundane thing called saving
                humanity.

                A very-very distant future. All the stars in the universe have
                collapsed — Eleazar is the only planet left where humankind
                still exists. Life there is extremely challenging as Eleazar’s
                vital resources are coming to an end. Citizens went deep
                underground in a desperate attempt to preserve whatever energy
                was left. The future was doom and gloom until scientists of
                Eleazar found out that the energy can be harvested from the
                radiation emitted by the Core of the planet in the form of
                Ejections. Everyone has to work together and dig deep to reach
                the Core. That’s the only way to save the planet and life on it.

                The planet Eleazar is divided into 1000 areas with five

                Fields (common rarity) while the rarest areas are DME Springs
                (legendary rarity) with the highest expectations from those who
